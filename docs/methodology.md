# EMPA Methodology

## What is EMPA?

**Estimation Methodology Plus Assessments** is a framework for delivering accurate project estimations. Its goal is to close the gap between estimated and actual effort.

## Methodology Phases

### 1. Scope Definition
- Identify functional and non-functional requirements
- Define expected deliverables
- Establish constraints and assumptions

### 2. Task Breakdown
- Split the project into modules
- Break each module into individual tasks
- Assign complexity level: Low / Medium / High

### 3. Estimation
- Estimate each task in hours
- Apply uncertainty factor based on complexity
  - Low: x1.2
  - Medium: x1.5
  - High: x2.0
- Sum estimates to get the total

### 4. Assessment
- Review estimates with the team
- Compare against similar past projects
- Adjust based on lessons learned

### 5. Tracking
- Log actual time vs estimated time
- Calculate deviation percentage
- Document findings for future projects

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Formula |
|--------|---------|
| Deviation | (Actual - Estimated) / Estimated × 100 |
| Accuracy | 100 - abs(Deviation) |
| Adjustment Factor | Average(Actual / Estimated) over last N projects |
